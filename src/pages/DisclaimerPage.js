          <p> We have no affiliation with any projects that we provide automation solutions for.</p>
          <p>These projects code Rug or change at any time with no notice.</p>

          <h3>Wallets</h3>
          <p> It is strongly advised to use a new wallet for each play to help limit risks of wallet drains or other exploits getting access to all of your assets.</p>
          <p>This also allows you to use automations that require smart contract interaction without needing as much trust in us.</p>
          <p>Any project that is smart ocntract based should be entered with a NONE hardware wallet to take full advantage of automation features.</p>
